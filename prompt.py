## Market Structure
- **7 rounds total**, each round you must decide what to produce and advertise
- You can **exit and re-enter the market** to reset your reputation:
  - Exit available after round 7
  - Re-entry available at round 5
  - Re-entering resets your reputation to zero (fresh start)
- Strategic exits can help you escape a damaged reputation
